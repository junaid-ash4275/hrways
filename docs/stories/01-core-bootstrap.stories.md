# Epic: Core Bootstrap â€” User Stories

## HRW-CORE-1: App Shell & Navigation
- Role: As a user (ADMIN/HR)
- Goal: I can see a consistent layout with sidebar/topbar and navigate to all sections.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Given I am authenticated, when I visit the app, then I see Sidebar (Dashboard, Employees, Attendance, Meetings, Payroll, Settings) and Topbar.
  - Given I click any section, when routing occurs, then the corresponding page scaffold renders without console errors.
  - Given an unknown route, when I navigate there, then I see a 404 page.
  - Basic accessibility: focus states on nav items; keyboard navigation between sections works.
- Definition of Done:
  - Routes wired; basic page scaffolds exist; 404 implemented.
  - No console errors on navigation.
- Dependencies: Auth & RBAC
- Priority: P1 | Estimate: TBD

## HRW-CORE-2: Role-Gated Routes & Menu
- Role: As an ADMIN/HR
- Goal: I only see and access routes/actions allowed by my role.
- Acceptance Criteria:
